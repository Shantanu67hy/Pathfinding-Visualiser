# Pathfinding Visualizer

An interactive **algorithm visualization platform** that demonstrates how classic graph search and shortest-path algorithms explore a grid in real time.
Built to showcase **data structures, algorithm design, performance optimization, and modern frontend engineering**.

## Overview

This project visualizes how different **pathfinding algorithms** behave on a 2D grid with walls, weights, and dynamic user interaction.

Users can:

* Place **start and end nodes**
* Draw **walls and obstacles**
* Generate **random mazes**
* Run multiple **pathfinding algorithms**
* Watch **step-by-step animated exploration**
* Compare **algorithm efficiency and path cost**

The goal is to transform abstract **DSA concepts** into an intuitive, visual learning experience.
